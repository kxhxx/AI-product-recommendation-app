# AI-Powered Furniture Recommendation App

This is a full-stack web application that provides furniture recommendations based on user queries using a multi-modal AI model. It also features an analytics dashboard and uses a GenAI model to create creative product descriptions.

## Features

- **Semantic Search:** Find furniture using natural language queries (e.g., "a comfortable blue sofa").
- **AI-Generated Descriptions:** Each recommended product comes with a unique, creative description generated by a Large Language Model.
- **Multi-modal Embeddings:** Utilizes the CLIP model to understand both text and image-based concepts.
- **Data Analytics:** A dedicated page to display visualizations and insights from the product dataset.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, and Pinecone as the vector database.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone
- **AI/ML:**
  - **Embeddings:** `sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32`
  - **Generative AI:** Groq API (Llama 3 8B)
  - **Integration:** LangChain
- **Data Science:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- An active virtual environment
- API keys for Pinecone and Groq

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Activate your Python virtual environment.
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:
    ```
    PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
    PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT="YOUR_ENV_HERE"
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
    ```
5.  Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup
